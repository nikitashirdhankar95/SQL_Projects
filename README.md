Heart Attack Risk Assessment SQL Project

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
To analyze and classify patients into Low, Moderate, and High risk categories for heart attacks using clinical data, and to support early diagnosis with corresponding medical recommendations.

ðŸ”¹ Skills Demonstrated
â€¢	SQL Data Analysis: Wrote queries to extract, group, and summarize key clinical and demographic metrics.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights & Results
â€¢	Dataset Overview: 1,319 patient records from Zheen Hospital (Erbil, Iraq), with 11 features including age, gender, heart rate, blood pressure, sugar levels, and cardiac enzymes.
â€¢	Risk Categorization: Clear distribution among Low, Moderate, and High risk groups; useful for prioritizing interventions.
â€¢	Demographic Trends: Older patients (age > 60) are more likely to be in the High Risk category.
â€¢	Gender Insights: Balanced gender representation; males showed higher average heart rates and blood sugar levels than females.
â€¢	Vital Signs: Systolic and diastolic pressure ranges help detect anomalies; extremes may signal urgent cases.
â€¢	Biomarker Focus: Top 5 Troponin levels correlate with critical cases needing immediate attention.
â€¢	Outcome Analysis: Positive vs. negative test results offer clarity in evaluating diagnosis accuracy.
â€¢	Medical Implications: Certain age groups and biomarker thresholds require urgent medical action.
